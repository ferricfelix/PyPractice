Tuples are immutable and memory efficient

list = [x,y]
dict = {x:y,y:x}
string = "" or ''
tuple = (x,y) #has to include a comma, otherwise just a single bit
tuple = tuple([1,2,3]) #another way

> a = 5
> b = 20
> a, b = b, a
> a = 20
> b = 5 # tuple unpacking

def add(base, *args):
	total = base
	for num in args:
		total += num
	return total

> add(5, 20)
25
	
#always in this order
def add(*args, **kwargs)
