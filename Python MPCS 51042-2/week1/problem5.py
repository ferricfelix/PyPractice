```
The City of Chicago publishes lots of open data for citizens like us to analyze. For this problem, you are provided a comma-separated value file employees.csv which contains information on all public employees in Chicago, their occupations, their departments, and their annual salary or hourly pay, whichever is applicable. Write a program that prints out the names and salaries of N highest paid (salaried) employees of Chicago. N should be given as a command line argument.
Although we have not covered it yet, you are allowed to use the csv standard library module if you wish. Otherwise, using normal file/strings methods will suffice. The csv module helps us deal with the fact that the first column has values containing commas, but is not strictly necessary here.
