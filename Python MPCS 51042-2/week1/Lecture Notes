Interpreted vs Compiled Language
* Compiled 
** Check the code to make sure it's valid
** Take instructions in one language, and make them into another language
* Interpreted

code > Python > interpreter (.pyc) > bytecode (pretty close to the original code but executable by the machine) > interpreter reads the .pyc and executes it

Python Implementations:
PyPy (implemented in RPython)
CPython ===> is what you should use!
Jython (interpreted in Java)
